Good evening, here is my answer.

> 1. Elaborate, using your own words, the definition of figure of speech by considering at least two experts' definition!
> 2. What figures of speech can you find in the Basic Reading textbook? Give an example of each in a sentence!
> 3. What are types of irony? Give an example for every type!

1. Definition

    Abrams (1996:69) tells that "*Figurative language is a conspicuous departure from what users of a language apprehend as the standard meaning of words, or else the standard order of words, in order to achieve some special meaning or effect*".

    So from that definition, we can tell that figure of speech is a way to tell that words are used for non-literal sense (simile, metaphore). Abrams tell that figure of speech is used to tell more specific than telling a fact.

    Arvius (2003:30) tells that "*the interest in figurative meanings, or tropes, has in many ways been inspired by the kind of approach to human experiences, behaviour, and mental capacities that we find within thegeneral*".

    From that definition, we know that figure of speech is from basic human nature of understanding and expressing experiences, behaviors, and mental capacities. So figure of speech is part of how we interact with the world and ourselves through languages.

2. Figure of speech

    1. Simile
        Simile using *like, as, as if, as...as* for comparing one thing to other thing.
        Example:
        - As slow as a sloth.
        - Sleeps like a baby.
    2. Metaphor
        Metaphor is direct comparing without using comparative words.
        Example:
        - He is like a shield to me.
        - Your eyes are like stars in the night sky.
    3. Personification
